So basically I have two playstation 4's that are both broken.

One of them turns on (blue light is flashing) but the TV won't pick up any signal. I tried removing the hard drive, swapping it with the Hard drive from a working PS4, and tried booting into safe mode but none of those worked. I have no idea how to fix this so I was using this as a donor. We'll call this PS4-\#1

The other PS4 doesn't turn on completely - it will beep and then the fan will attempt to start up then it immediately shuts off. We'll call this PS4-\#2

So what I went ahead and did was take apart both PS4s and I figured that the issue with PS4-\#2 is that the power supply or fan is messed up. I basically transferred PS4-\#2s motherboard into PS4-\#1s housing with PS4-\#1's power supply & fan assembly. I put it back together and no luck. The same issue is present.

Now what I'm planning on doing is waiting for some thermal paste (arctic silver 5) to arrive so I can try that (since it did look a bit dried up) but I was just curious if any of you have any ideas on what else I should try.

tl;dr swapped power supply and fan for PS4 which wouldn't power on correctly. Problem still persists. Any other parts or ideas on what to do?
