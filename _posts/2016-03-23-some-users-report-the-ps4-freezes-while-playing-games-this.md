Some users report the PS4 freezes while playing games. This can lead to lost progress and plenty of frustration for gamers. This is a common problem, but does not appear to be widespread. There are two main things users should do if this happens.

The first thing to do is look for any PS4 updates. Sony periodically releases new software for the PS4 that fixes bugs and performance issues. This could fix PS4 freezing for many users that may have skipped an update.

If the PS4 freezes after playing it for extended periods make sure it is not overheating. If it is in an enclosed entertainment center or it is not on a smooth surface it may be overheating. If this is the case moving the PS4 to a more open area could prevent freezing during long gameplay sessions.

If you still have PS4 problems contacting support is the best option, but hopefully these solutions save you time.

For users who cannot fix these or other PS4 Problems,[Sony Support][0]is the next stop. The PS4 is only months old, so any issues not caused by abuse or accidents should be covered under the included warranty. Users can talk to support on chat or by phone with an average wait of 15 minutes on the phone or no wait on chat at this time.
