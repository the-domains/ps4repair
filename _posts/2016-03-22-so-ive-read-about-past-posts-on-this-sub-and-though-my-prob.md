So I've read about past posts on this sub and though my problem is similar, it's still different than the others.

So I unplug my hdmi cable for the first time in months and I plug it back in to be greeted with a black screen. Did the reset thingy and went to change the resolution so it came to 480p and it worked. But the problem is I can't use any other resolution, 1080i totally blacks out the screen and if I switch to 720 or 1080p, more than half of the screen is blacked and another part blinking a meshy black and white pattern across the screen leaving only 480p.

Please help

TL;DR : I'm getting a black screen on 1080i resolution and a half black screen and meshy black and white pattern across the screen on 720p and 1080p.
